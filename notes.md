### Notes

1) server components
2) routing out of the box (file based)
3) client side components are also prepared and sent to the client as placeholders and then replaced once the client renders it, this is a process called hydration 
4) nested routes using [name]
5) route grouping can be done using (name)
6) static site generation
7) incremental site generation
8) partial pre rendering
